"""Submission readiness gate. Python 3.9+, standard library only, no install step.

WHAT THIS IS
    One file you copy into a new entry, edit the CONFIG block at the top, and
    run. It scores weighted judging criteria out of 100, fetches the live judge
    URL and refuses to pass while that URL is not serving, prints user-gated
    items separately, writes readiness.json, and sets an exit code CI can gate on.

THE TWO RULES IT EXISTS TO ENFORCE
    1. A readiness gate that never opens a socket is not evidence. The gate this
       replaces was 10,092 lines of regex over source files with zero fetch
       calls, and it stayed green through a two-day total outage of the demo.
       Here the live probe is a VETO: it is not one weighted line item that a
       high score can outvote. If the judge URL is not serving, the verdict is
       FAIL at any score.
    2. user-gated is a third status, never a pass. A user-gated check is
       removed from its criterion's denominator, is never counted as passed,
       and prints in its own block with the manual step still to be done.

EXIT CODES
    0   weighted score >= THRESHOLD and every live check served as expected
    1   gate failed: score below THRESHOLD, or a live check did not serve
    2   nothing was verified: --offline was passed, or the config is still
        carrying the placeholder judge URL, or the weights do not sum to 100
        within half a point, or readiness.py is not one directory below the root.
        readiness.json records submission_grade false. Never treat 2 as a pass.
    An unreachable URL is exit 1, not exit 2. From a CI runner "unreachable" and
    "down" look identical, and a judge cannot tell them apart either.

    No flag in this script can produce exit 0 without a real 200 from a real
    server. --offline is for local iteration and is structurally unable to go
    green.

USAGE
    python readiness.py                  # full gate, probes live, writes readiness.json
    python readiness.py --offline        # skip the probe, exit 2, not submission grade
    python readiness.py --selftest       # prove the gate has teeth, exit 0 if it does
    python readiness.py --out PATH --quiet

PROVENANCE
    Structure, three-state model, evidence primitives, readiness.json artifact:
        an earlier readiness gate in this workspace (579 lines)
    Explicit numeric weights per criterion, 95 percent gate threshold, the
    third "user-gated" status as a first-class value:
        a second one in this workspace (2,110 lines)
    Rejected as the base: a third, 10,092 lines, with a measured zero
    verified zero fetch calls (grep -cE "fetch\\(|axios|http\\.get|https\\.get"
    returns 0). Its live probe lives in a separate scheduled workflow that
    cannot turn a pull request red.
    Changed on the way in, deliberately:
      - nebius made the live probe user_gated, so an outage could not fail it.
        Here it is a veto.
      - nebius accepted 401 and 403 as "live". A judge who gets 403 has no demo.
        Here only the expected status counts, and a body substring must match.
      - nebius scored a criterion with no automatable checks as 100 percent.
        Here it scores 0.
